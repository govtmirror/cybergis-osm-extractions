CyberGIS OSM Extractions (cybergis-osm-extractions)
================

## Description

This repository contains scripts for running OpenStreetmap (OSM) extractions.

Please see the OSM Extracts guides in the cybergis-guides repo at [https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-guides/blob/master/1.0/cybergis-guides-osmextracts-1.0.md](https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-guides/blob/master/1.0/cybergis-guides-osmextracts-1.0.md) for information on how to set up an OSM extracts server.

### CyberGIS
The Humanitarian Information Unit has been developing a sophisticated geographic computing infrastructure referred to as the CyberGIS. The CyberGIS provides highly available, scalable, reliable, and timely geospatial services capable of supporting multiple concurrent projects.  The CyberGIS relies on primarily open source projects, such as PostGIS, GeoServer, GDAL, GeoGit, OGR, and OpenLayers.  The name CyberGIS is dervied from the term geospatial cyberinfrastructure.

### ROGUE
The Rapid Opensource Geospatial User-Driven Enterprise (ROGUE) Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) is a two-year research & development project developing the technology for distributed geographic data creation and synchronization in a disconnected environement.  This new technology taken altogether is referred to as GeoSHAPE.  See [http://geoshape.org](http://geoshape.org) for more information.  HIU is leveraging the technology developed through ROGUE to build out the CyberGIS into a robust globally distributed infrastruture.

## Installation

These installation instructions are subject to change.  Right now, since there are no debian package dependencies, you can really extract the repo to whatever directory you want.  The instructions below are suggested as they mirror Linux best practices for external packages.

As root, execute the following commands:
```
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-osm-extractions.git cybergis-osm-extractions.git
```

The CyberGIS Scripts repo (cybergis-scripts) also contains some tools for automating the process of creating OpenStreetMap extracts.  See the installation guide at [https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-scripts](https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-scripts).

## Usage

Extents are currently limited to bounding boxes in the `S W N E` format to conform closely to the `osm download` command explained in the [Downloading data from an OSM Server](http://geogig.org/docs/interaction/osm.html#downloading-data-from-an-osm-serve) section of the GeoGig User Manual.  Complex geometry extents are possible but are not sufficiently integrated to work at scale.  You can do complex geometry extents, but it currently requires hand writing filters using the [Overpass Query Language](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Language_Guide).

The easist mapping to start with is the `basic:buildings_and_roads` mapping available at [[link]](https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-osm-mappings/blob/master/mappings/basic/buildings_and_roads.json).

You can learn more about OSM mappings from the GeoGig User Manual at [http://geogig.org/docs/interaction/osm.html#data-mapping](http://geogig.org/docs/interaction/osm.html#data-mapping).

To learn how to create extracts check out the OSM Extracts CyberGIS Guide at [[link]](https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-guides/blob/master/1.0/cybergis-guides-osmextracts-1.0.md).  You can also look at examples of extracts of [Khulna, Bangladesh](https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-scripts/tree/master/examples/khulna) and [Ebola Crisis](https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-scripts/tree/master/examples/ebola).
